        <h3><p> My love/addiction for rhythm games started around 8th grade. There's something about tapping notes to the beat that gets me exhilerated. So, for this project, I decided to make a rhythm game that revolves around music that I enjoy lisening to.</p></h3><br><br>
      <h3><p>In the menu, the "CREDIT" button will take you to the list of songs I used for my game, each with their composers. Pressing "PLAY" would take you to a tutorial, where the controls are taught to prepare you for the main game.</p></h3><br><br>
      <h3><p>DISCLAIMER: I never actually finished making any of the beat maps due to my unexplainable time management. The only level with a decent amount of notes is "Reanimate". Enjoy </p></h3>
